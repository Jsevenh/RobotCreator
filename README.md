FreeCAD Workbench for URDF &amp; SDF and Gazebo

NOTE, THIS PROJECT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT, its not fully functional yet.

What works:
Sdf export of links: 
  - correctly scaled mesh exported as stl 
  - inertia and collision geometry is based on stl
  
Joint export (in progress):
  - can create joints objects and move them around in FreeCAD
  - can only be exported as a hinge joint arond x axis for the momemnt
  - gui in progress

Note, video is from before the scaling was implemented (FreeCAD exports in mm and gazebo imports in m)
